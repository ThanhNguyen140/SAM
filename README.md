# SAM Lab
This README should be a help in giving an overview on who wrote what code for our lab 'Explore the effectiveness of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in medical images'.

The notebooks are split in the lisa and thanh folders. All of the code inside was written independently by the person respectively.

For the functions and scripts that can be found in the functions folder the work was done as follows:
- script preprocess.py written by Thanh
- script generate_embeddings.py written by Lisa
- class modifiedPredictor written by Thanh
- classes in pipeline.py written by Thanh
- class Prompt written by Lisa
- functions in sam_functions.py written by Lisa except show_mask() and show_points(); those are from https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything
